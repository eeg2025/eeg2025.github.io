## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Model Requirements and Recommendations**

**Q: What are the computational requirements for models?**
A: Models should be able to run on a single GPU with 20 GB of memory. For testing purposes, use a batch size of one subject.

### **Team Composition**

**Q: Can I be part of multiple teams?**
A: No, participants can only be part of one team. Multiple accounts for the same person are not allowed.

**Q: Is there a limit on team size?**
A: No, there is no size limit for teams.

**Q: Who should be designated as the team leader?**
A: Each team should identify one leader who will be responsible for presenting the solution if the team wins and for coordinating prize sharing among team members.

### **Submissions and Model Usage**

**Q: Can I use external datasets in addition to the provided data?**
A: Yes, you can use other datasets, but you must clearly mention and document any additional data sources used in your submission.

**Q: Are pre-trained foundation models allowed?**
A: Yes, you are more than welcome to use existing foundation models, but you must clearly mention and document which pre-trained models were used and how they were fine-tuned in your submission.

### **Data Access**

**Q: Where can I access the competition dataset?**
A: The HBN-EEG dataset is available on NEMAR.org and Amazon S3. For detailed download links and access information, please visit [dataset page](https://neuromechanist.github.io/data/hbn/).

**Q: Are there smaller datasets available for initial exploration?**
A: Yes, mini datasets for each release are available for download. You can access these either as zip files or via Google Drive links provided on the [dataset page](https://neuromechanist.github.io/data/hbn/).
