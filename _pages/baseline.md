We will provide baseline code at this website. This code relies on the [Braindecode](https://braindecode.org) and [EEGDash](https://eegdash.org) libraries. These libraries allow data search, loading, fetching, and readily applying deep learning methods on EEG data. The provided scripts are only for reference, and the contestants can freely use their codebase for development.
