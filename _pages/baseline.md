The start kit will be released following the timeline details, to give equal opportunities to people who cannot download the dataset, and will depend our infrastructure to run the code.

This code relies on the [Braindecode](https://braindecode.org) and [EEGDash](https://eegdash.org) libraries. These libraries allow data search, loading, fetching, and readily applying deep learning methods on EEG data. The provided scripts are only for reference, and the contestants can freely use their codebase for development.
